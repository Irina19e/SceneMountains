## Mountain-Road OpenGL Scene

A single 3D scene using legacy OpenGL code allowing a basic navigation using mouse. The code is based on GLUT, without using external libraries (using [glm] would be nice!).

To run the code, [CMake] is necessary or just manually adding the libraries/environment to work with GLUT (or freeglut).

Code uses a bypass shaders (vertex and fragment), just to see a cube spinning.
